# Self-studying pre-Master Mathematics
This repository lays out my journey of self-studying bachelor level Mathematics subjects, instrumental to pre-Master courses (as in the Netherlands). I will compile my notes here and exercises from reliable sources like the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/exams/) and more.

# Subjects include:

  - **Introduction Mathematics**
  - **Multivariable analysis**
  - **Real Analysis**
  - **Rings and Fields**
  - **Ordinary Differential Equations**
  - **Group Theory**
  - **Topology**
  - **Linear Algebra**
For this subject, I learn from [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/exams/) and [Skancity Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLInywrvFyvq4IE-nW-ikwkZ2v81n31HQX).
 
While I have some experience on Linear Algebra and Real Analysis, I intend to revisit them to refresh my memory.

# Self-studying pre-Master Mathematics
This repository lays out my journey of self-studying bachelor level Math subjects, instrumental to pre-Master courses (as in the Netherlands).

# Subjects include:

  - **Introduction Mathematics**
  - **Multivariable analysis**
  - **Real Analysis**
  - **Rings and Fields**
  - **Ordinary Differential Equations**
  - **Group Theory**
  - **Topology**
  - **Linear Algebra**

While I have some experience on Linear Algebra and Real Analysis, I intend to revisit them.
